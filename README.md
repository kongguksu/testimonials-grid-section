## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to span a card's size using span value on grid-row property.

```css
.card-white-long {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  height: 100%;
  grid-row: span 2;
}
```

### Continued development

I felt the need to learn more about different CSS Grid properties and values especially when creating a complex grid layout.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69317523/how-to-use-row-span-in-a-css-grid/69317649#69317649?newreg=92bddd0de46b49ddad5b3627c91f0311) - This helped me use the span value of grid row property to help me make the class 'card-white-long' expand its height over two rows.
